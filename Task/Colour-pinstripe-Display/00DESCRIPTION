The task is to create 1 pixel wide coloured vertical pinstripes with a sufficient number of pinstripes to span the entire width of the graphics display. The pinstripes should either follow the system palette sequence or a sequence that includes Black, Red, Green, Blue, Magenta, Cyan, Yellow, White.

After filling the top quarter of the display, we switch to a wider 2 pixel wide vertical pinstripe pattern. Halfway down the display we switch to 3 pixel wide vertical pinstripe and then finally to a 4 pixels wide vertical pinstripe for the last quarter of the display.
